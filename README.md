# CSE148 Repository

This repo contains lecture, homework, and exam code from my CSE148-Object Oriented Programming at SCC College in Spring 2022. This class served as an introduction to Object Oriented Programming topics such as objects/classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. Folders beginning with "HW" correspond to homework code and folders beginning with "L" correspond to lecture code. All code was done in Java using the Eclipse IDE.


## Topics/Code Included:

* Classes and Objects
* Deep/Shallow Copies
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Interfaces
* Exception Handling
* File Input/Output
* Intro to GUI(with JavaFX)






## Class Syllabus

* Construct multiple-file or multiple-module programming solutions that use class hierarchies, inheritance, and polymorphism to reuse existing design and code.
* Construct object oriented programming solutions for reuse, using Abstract Data Types that incorporate encapsulation, data abstraction, and information hiding.
* Create programming solutions that use data structures and existing libraries.
* Design and develop secure and fault-tolerant programs that mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
* Discuss significant trends and societal impacts related to computing, software, and the Internet.
* Produce graphical user interfaces that incorporate simple color models and handle events.
* Handle binary I/O, object I/O, and random access files.
* Use recursion to solve simple programming problems: factorials, Fibonacci numbers, and tower of Hanoi.
* Proficiently use a professional IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans for coding and debugging.
* Write secure programs of at least 500 lines of source code with multiple functions and multiple classes involving GUI, binary and object I/O, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, and commonly used data structures.
